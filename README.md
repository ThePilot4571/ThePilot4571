As a wise man once said
# I want MONEY. All I want is MONEY.
I don't get the way you guys think. I want MONEY. 6 figures right out of college. 200k a year entry level. I'm in this for MONEY. I don't care about whether I'm "fufilled" I want MONEY. Whatever gets me the most MONEY. What technology gets me PAID THE BEST. All I care about in this major is MONEY. That's why I'm in college, I don't wanna laugh and play with y'all. I don't wanna be buddy buddy with y'all. I'm here for MONEY.
